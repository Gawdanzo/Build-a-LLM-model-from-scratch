# Build-a-LLM-Model (Refined)

> A clean, research-grade repository for building and fine-tuning Transformer/LLM models from scratch and with Hugging Face, optimized for PhD applications and reproducibility.

## What's inside

- **Educational-to-Research trajectory**: notebooks that start from attention basics to a working GPT-like model, then move to instruction fine-tuning.
- **Reproducible structure**: `src/` package + `scripts/` CLIs + pinned `requirements` + tests + CI stub.
- **Data hygiene**: all raw assets under `data/raw/` with clear provenance.
- **Docs**: figures and paper-style assets live in `docs/`.
- **No clutter**: legacy artifacts removed or migrated to the right place.
