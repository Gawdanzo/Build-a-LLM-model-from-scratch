3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Once installed, locate the application in your Start Menu and double-click to launch.

### For macOS:

1. Open the Downloads folder.
2. Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file.
3. Drag the application to your Applications folder.
4. Open the Applications folder and double-click the software to run it.

### For Linux:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `.tar.gz` file.
3. Run the command `tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz` to extract the files.
4. Change to the extracted directory using `cd dirname`.
5. Run the application with `./application_name`.

## üåü How to Use the Application

Once the application is running, follow these steps to build your own language model:

1. **Data Preparation:** 
   - Gather text data that you want to train on.
   - Ensure that your data is clean and saved in a compatible format (like .txt).

2. **Tokenizer Setup:**
   - Use the application to set up a tokenizer.
   - This step converts your text data into a format that the model can understand.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Choose the desired training configurations.
   - Start the training process by clicking on the "Train" button. 

4. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, evaluate your model‚Äôs performance.
   - Use the in-built evaluation tools to test your model.

5. **Sample Generation:**
   - Generate text samples using your trained model.
   - Adjust the parameters to see different outputs.

## üìÑ Configuration Files

The application comes with clean and reproducible configuration files. These files allow you to easily adjust settings like:

- Batch size
- Learning rate
- Number of training epochs

You can find these configuration files in the installation directory. Feel free to modify them to suit your needs.

## üß™ Advanced Features

This application supports advanced features for enhanced performance:

- **AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision):** Optimizes the training process, making it faster and more efficient.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Allows for efficient fine-tuning of large models with minimal compute.
- **DDP (Distributed Data Parallel):** Enables training over multiple GPUs to speed up the process.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the software, consider these solutions:

- **Application Won't Open:** Ensure that your operating system meets the requirements. Check for missing dependencies.
- **Training Issues:** Make sure your data is formatted correctly and the paths are set in the configuration files.
- **Performance Problems:** Check if your system has enough memory and that your graphics card drivers are up-to-date.
